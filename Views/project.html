            <p>This first project is something that as a absolutely entry level developer made me very proud. It really is rudimentary, crude, and not well polished. But it was <strong>THE</strong> first project I had worked on in a agile enviorment. It was also the first project built during a very intense learning and enlightenment portion of my life. Please enjoy this pet program... and seriously, adopt your next pet!</p>

         <div id="project_two">
            <p>Hero Match is a application that was made in under two weeks time, with a six person student developer team. It was developed to streamline the process of entering and playing popular online video games. We coded this from scratch, in a agile team setting, with no framewroks used, just good ol' coding. The project includes integration's of multiple API's for character description, is full stack, and styled by the team. Please check out the link..</p>
